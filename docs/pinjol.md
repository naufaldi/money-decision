## Alternatives to Pinjol

Before taking pinjol, consider:

1. **Employer salary advance** - Many companies offer 0% interest advances
2. **Family support** - Temporary help from relatives (document clearly)
3. **Formal bank loans** - 12-24% APR vs 50-100%+ from pinjol
4. **Cooperative loans** - Lower rates for members
5. **Credit card** - 20-30% APR (still better than high pinjol rates)

## Debt Consolidation Strategy

If you have multiple pinjol debts:

1. **List all debts** - Amount, interest rate, minimum payment
2. **Calculate total burden** - Should not exceed 30% of income
3. **Contact OJK** - Call 157 for counseling and complaint
4. **Explore consolidation** - Formal banks offer 12-24% APR loans
5. **Use avalanche method** - Pay highest interest rate first

## Resources & Support

- **OJK Hotline:** 157 (complaints and financial counseling)
- **Financial Counseling:** Free consultations available
- **Debt Consolidation:** Formal banks (BRI, BCA, Mandiri) offer lower rates
- **Legal Aid:** If harassed by illegal collectors

## Prevention Tips

✅ **Do:**

- Build 3-6 month emergency fund before considering pinjol
- Only borrow for genuine emergencies
- Read all terms and calculate total repayment
- Use OJK-registered lenders only
- Set up automatic savings to prevent cash gaps

❌ **Don't:**

- Borrow for consumption (lifestyle, gadgets, etc.)
- Take new pinjol to pay off old pinjol
- Ignore debt - contact lenders if struggling
- Use illegal/unregistered pinjol apps
- Borrow more than 20% of monthly income

## Impact on Financial Planning

If you have pinjol debt:

1. **Priority:** Pay off high-interest debt (>50% APR) before investing
2. **Budget Adjustment:** Allocate extra to debt payoff temporarily
3. **Emergency Fund:** Still maintain minimum 1-month fund while paying debt
4. **Investment:** Delay aggressive investing until debt under control
5. **Savings Rate:** May need to reduce temporarily to 5-10% while tackling debt

**Remember:** Pinjol is not inherently bad, but high-interest pinjol can trap you in a debt cycle. Always calculate the true cost and explore alternatives first.
