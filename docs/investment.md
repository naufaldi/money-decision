## Investment Principles

### 1. Diversify Your Portfolio
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread investments across different asset classes and instruments to reduce risk.

### 2. Match Investment to Time Horizon
- Short-term (1-2 years): Low-risk instruments (Savings, Money Market, Bonds)
- Medium-term (3-5 years): Mix of bonds and equities
- Long-term (5+ years): Higher allocation to growth assets (Stocks, Equity Funds)

### 3. Pay Off High-Interest Debt First
Credit card debt at 20%+ interest should be prioritized before investing. The guaranteed "return" from paying off high-interest debt exceeds most investment returns.

### 4. Start Early and Be Consistent
Compound interest works best over time. Even small regular investments can grow significantly.

### 5. Use Regulated Platforms
Only use platforms licensed by OJK. This provides consumer protection and reduces fraud risk.

### 6. Review and Rebalance Regularly
Monitor your portfolio and rebalance annually to maintain your target allocation.
